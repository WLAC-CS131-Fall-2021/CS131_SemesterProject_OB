# CS131_SemesterProject_OB
This is my semester project in discrete mathematics on dynamic programming using the Fibonacci sequence as an example

Here is the link to my semester project.

This project uses the example of the Fibonacci sequence to explain the time complexity issue that computations and processing time have once the computing gets too much. Dynamic programing uses methods of memorization and space complexity to illustrate the endless possibilities this approach  can bring.
